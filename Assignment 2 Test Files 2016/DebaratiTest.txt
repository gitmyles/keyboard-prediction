Stop and shop has multiple. Okay. Sometimes it is steady red and sometimes it is flashing. Ok. I have not been able to offload the data off of here in a few days. Because it will not. You know because of the software trouble. So I do not know whether it is full or its battery is dead or what is going on. Ok. That is this battery?  We just replaced it like a week ago. Ok. Ok. What I do not understand is if the nine volt battery is dead why is the light still flashing. Should not it show that it is dead? Yeah it is really difficult. Ok so we have that problem and you know it is frustrating to not be able to record with the you know knowing that the GPS is taking data. Alright so I am just going to start opening up all of these and annotating the. Alright. I just from the command line I just had this output all the directory contents into this xls file. The problem is I could not figure out how to get it to tab delimit or comma delimit or comma separate. So. Yeah if you can easily do that because now these are just all on the same line and it would be a little bit easier if we could you know operate on the columns yeah you know as separate cells. Ok. Ok. Yeah at least for our meeting with her I will just do it the old fashioned way. Right. Ok. I I am afraid that every data that all the speech data is going to have to be transcribed manually. Because like there is half the data is with the jabra and half the data is with this and. To even be able to use the recognizer to recognize half the new half of the data it is going to take you know it is going to take a long time to build that voice model and I think that in terms of the efficiency it may just be faster to listen to everything and transcribe it. Because I know how much time that is going to take. But we can we can look into that. Yeah. Definitely. Ok so I am going to start to generate these durations here. Not yet we are going to get one in about twenty minutes

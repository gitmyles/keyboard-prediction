he principle of economic integration. this fact is evident in the recruitment of new members.#mission as co-optation#the rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary outreach of the major denominations. there is much talk in theological circles about the "church as mission" and the "church's mission"; theologians have been stressing the fact that the church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world. a crucial question, therefore, is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan protestantism. if economic integration really shapes congregational life, then evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration. the task of a congregation would be defined, according to economic integration, as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation. (co-optation means to choose by joint action in order to fill a vacancy; it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power from an environment in order to strengthen an organization.) in a mobile society, congregational health depends on a constant process of recruitment; this recruitment, however, must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation; therefore, the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation rather than proclamation- like elements will have to be assimilated.evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully studied in the churches; one study in pittsburgh, however, has illuminated the situation. in a sample of new members of pittsburgh churches, almost 60 per cent were recruited by initial "contacts with friendly members". if we add to these contacts with friendly members the "contacts with an organization of the church" (11.2 per cent of the cases), then a substantial two thirds of all recruitment is through friendly contact. on the surface, this seems a sound approach to christian mission: members of the congregation show by their friendly attitudes that they care for new people; the new people respond in kind by joining the church.   missionary outreach by friendly contact looks somewhat different when one reflects on what is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods; the majority of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic position; association by level of achievement is the dominant principle of informal relations. this means that the antennae of the congregation are extended into the community, picking up the wave lengths of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation; the mission of the church is actually a process of informal co-optation; the lay ministry is a means to recruit like-minded people who will strengthen the social class nucleus of the congregation. churches can be strengthened through this process of co-optation so long as the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people who can fit the pattern of economic integration; once the pool of recruits diminishes, the congregation is helpless- friendly contacts no longer keep it going.   the transmutation of mission to co-optation is further indicated by the insignificance of educational activities, worship, preaching, and publicity in reaching new members. the proclamation of the churches is almost totally confined to pastoral contacts by the clergy (17.3 per cent of new members) and friendly contacts by members (over two thirds if organizational activities are included). publicity accounted for 1.1 per cent of the initial contacts with new members. in general, friendly contact with a member followed by contact with a clergyman will account for a major share of recruitment by the churches, making it quite evident that the extension of economic integration through co-optation is the principal form of mission in the contemporary church; economic integration and co-optation are the two methods by which protestants associate with and recruit from the neighborhood. the inner life of congregations will prosper so long as like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize together; the outer life of congregations- the suitability of the environment to their survival- will be propitious so long as the people in the area are of the same social and economic level as the membership. economic integration ceases when the social and economic statuses in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of the congregation. in a rapidly changing society congregations will run into difficulties repeatedly, since such nice balances of economic integration are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more than a single generation. the fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of this struggle to maintain economic balance. the expense of this type of organization in religious life, when one recalls the number of city churches which deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned, raises fundamental questions about the principle of protestant survival in a mobile society; nonetheless, the prevalence of economic integration in congregations illumines the nature of the protestant development. it was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had split into two trends- expanding interdependence on an impersonal basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings. these trends seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis. residential associations struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions. the motifs of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential communities have polarized; the schism between central city and suburb, negro and white, blue collar and white collar can be viewed as symptomatic of this deeper polarization of trends in the metropolis. it now becomes evident that the denominational church is intimately involved with the economy of middle-class culture, for it serves to crystallize the social class identity of middle-class residential groupings. the accelerated pace of metropolitan changes has accentuated the drive to conformity in congregations of the major denominations. this conformity represents a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable environment. more than creatures of metropolitan forces, the churches have taken the lead in counteracting the interdependence of metropolitan life, crystallizing and perpetuating the stratification of peoples, giving form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world of heterogeneous peoples.   since american life is committed above all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life, the countervailing forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have fought a desperate, rearguard action against the expanding interdependence of the metropolis. consumer communities have suffered at the hands of the productive interests. negroes, puerto ricans, and rural newcomers are slowly making their way into the cities. soon they will fight their way into the lower middle-class suburbs, and the churches will experience the same decay and rebuilding cycle which has characterized their history for a century. the identification of the basic unit of religious organization- the parish or congregation- with a residential area is self-defeating in a modern metropolis, for it simply means the closing of an iron trap on the outreach of the christian fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation. mission to the metropolis contradicts survival of the congregation in the residential community, because the middle classes are fighting metropolitan interdependence with residential exclusion.   this interpretation of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could lead to various projections for the churches. it could be argued that any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods is doomed to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the middle classes. it could be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain religious activity, since worship presupposes some local stabilities. whatever projection one makes, the striking fact about congregational and parochial life is the extent to which it is a vehicle of the social identity of middle-class people.   attention will be given in the next chapter to the style of association in the denominational churches; this style is characteristically an expression of the communal style of the middle classes. the keynotes of this style are activism and emphasis on achievements in gaining self-esteem. these values give direction to the life of the middle-class man or woman, dictating the methods of child rearing, determining the pattern of community participation, setting the style for the psychiatric treatment of middle-class illness, and informing the congregational life of the major denominations. "fellowship by likeness" and "mission by friendly contact" form the iron cage of denominational religion. its contents are another matter, for they reveal the kinds of interests pursued by the congregation. what goes on in the cage will occupy our attention under the rubric of the organization church. an understanding of the new role of residential association in an industrial society serves to illuminate the forces which have fashioned the iron cage of conformity which imprisons the churches in their suburban captivity.the perplexing question still remains as to why the middle classes turn to the churches as a vehicle of social identity when their clubs and charities should fill the same need. with capital largely squandered, there seemed to them no other course to pursue.   the directors sold directly to concessionaires, who had to make their profits above the high prices asked by the company. these concessionaires traded where they wished and generally dealt with the indians through <engages>, who might be <habitants, voyageurs>, or even soldiers. the concessionaires also had to pay a tax of one-tenth on the goods they traded, and all pelts were to be taken to company stores and shipped to france in company ships. the company disposed of the pelts, but with what profit, the records do not show.in accord with its penurious policy, the company failed to furnish presents to hold the loyalty of the principal indians. the lavish use of presents had been effective in expanding the indian trade of new france and louisiana in the previous century, and the change in liberality aroused resentment in the minds of the red men. traders from the english colonies were far more generous, and indian loyalty turned to them. protests from governors and intendants passed unheeded, and the parsimonious policy of the company probably let loose indian insurrections that brought ruin to the company.   in 1721 the king sent three commissioners to louisiana with full powers to do all that was necessary to protect the colony. they ordered the raising of troops and obtained 75,000 livres with which to build forts. they adopted a program by which louisiana was divided into five districts. in each of these there was to be a strong military post, and a trading depot to supply the smaller trading houses. for southeastern louisiana, mobile was the principal post, and it was to furnish supplies for trade to the north and east, in the region threatened by british traders. mobile was to be the anchor of a chain of posts extending northward to the sources of the tennessee river. fort toulouse, on the alabama river, had been erected in 1714 for trade with the alabamas and choctaws, but money was available for only one other new post, near the present nashville, tennessee, and this was soon abandoned.west of the mobile district was the lower mississippi district, of which new orleans was headquarters. dependent upon it were posts on the lower mississippi and the region westward to the frontiers of new spain.   on the middle mississippi a principal post was to be located near the mouth of the arkansas. it was hoped that to this post would flow a large quantity of furs from the west, principally down the arkansas river. on the ohio or wabash was to be built another post "at the fork of two great rivers". other posts would be established up the ohio and wabash to protect communication with canada. on the upper mississippi the illinois post was to be established near kaskaskia, and dependent posts were to be built on the missouri, "where there are mines in abundance". each of the five principal posts was to have a director, responsible to a director-general at new orleans. an elaborate system of accounting and reports was worked out, and the trade was to be managed in the most scientific way. concessionaires were to be under the supervision of the directors. <engages> must be loyal to the concessionaires, and must serve until the term provided in the engagement was ended. the <habitants> were to be encouraged to trade and were to dispose of their pelts to the concessionaires.   only two principal storehouses were actually established- one at mobile, the other at new orleans. new orleans supplied the goods for the trade on the mississippi, and west of that river, and on the ohio and wabash. mobile was also supplied by new orleans with goods for the mobile district.the power that bienville exercised during his first administration cannot be determined. regulations for the indian trade were made by the <conseil superieure de la louisiane>, and bienville apparently did not have control of that body. the <conseil> even treated the serious matter of british aggression as its business and, on its own authority, sent to disaffected savages merchandise "suitable for the peltry trade". it decided, also, that the purely secular efforts of bienville were insufficient, and sent missionaries to win the savages from the heathen carolinians.   during the first administration of bienville, the peltry trade of the mobile district was a lucrative source of revenue. the alabamas brought in annually 15,000 to 20,000 deerskins, and the choctaws and chickasaws brought the total up to 50,000 pelts. these deerskins were the raw material for the manufacture of leather, and were the only articles which the tribes of this district had to exchange for european goods. during his first administration, bienville succeeded in keeping carolina traders out of the alabama country and the choctaw country. the director of the post at mobile kept an adequate amount of french goods, of a kind to which they were accustomed, to supply the indian needs. the alabama and tombigbee rivers furnished a highway by which goods could be moved quickly and cheaply. de la laude, commander of the alabama post, had the friendship of the natives, and was able to make them look upon the british as poor competitors. diron d'artaguette, the most prominent trader in the district, was energetic and resourceful, but his methods often aroused the ire of the french governors. he became, after a time, commander of a post on the alabama river, but his operations extended from mobile throughout the district, and he finally obtained a monopoly of the indian trade.   the chickasaws were the principal source of trouble in the mobile district. their territory lay to the north, near the sources of the alabama, the tombigbee, the tennessee, and cumberland rivers, and was easily accessible to traders among the near-by cherokees. in 1720 some chickasaws massacred the french traders among them, and did not make peace for four years. venturesome traders, however, continued to come to them from mobile, and to obtain a considerable number of pelts for the french markets. british traders from south carolina incited the indians against the french, and there developed french and british factions in the tribe. the chickasaws finally were the occasion for the most disastrous wars during the french control of louisiana. to hold them was an essential part of french policy, for they controlled the upper termini of the routes from the north to mobile. they threatened constantly to give the british a hold on this region, from whence they could move easily down the rivers to the french settlements near the gulf.   bienville realized that if the french were to hold the southeastern tribes against the enticements of british goods, french traders must be able to offer a supply as abundant as the carolinians and at reasonable prices. his urgings brought some results. the company of the indies promised to send over a supply of indian trading goods, and to price them more cheaply in terms of deerskins. but it coupled with this a requirement that indians must bring their pelts to mobile and thus save all costs of transportation into and out of the indian country.   the insistence of bienville upon giving liberal prices to the indians, in order to drive back the carolina traders, was probably a factor that led to his recall in 1724. for two years his friend and cousin, boisbriant, remained as acting governor and could do little to stem the anglican advance. although he incited a few friendly indians to pillage the invaders, and even kill some of them, the carolina advance continued.the company was impressed with some ideas of the danger from carolina, and when perier came over as governor in 1727, he was given special instructions regarding the trade of the mobile district. but the company of the indies, holding to its program of economy, made no arrangements to furnish better goods at attractive prices. to the directors the problem appeared a matter of intrigue or diplomacy. perier attempted to understand the problem by sending agents to inquire among the indians. these agents were to ascertain the difference between english and french goods, and the prices charged the indians. they were to conciliate the unfriendly savages, and, wherever possible, to incite the natives to pillage the traders from carolina. they were to promise fine presents to the loyal red men, as well as an abundant supply of trading goods at better prices than the opposition was offering. perier's intrigues gained some successes. the savages divided into two factions; one was british and the other, french. so hostile did these factions become that, among the choctaws, civil war broke out.   perier's efforts, however, were on the whole ineffective in winning back the tribes of the mobile district, and he decided to send troops into the troubled country. he asked the government for two hundred soldiers, who were to be specifically assigned to arrest english traders and disloyal indians. in spite of the company's restrictions, he planned to build new posts in the territory. he asked also for more supplies to trade at a low price for the indians' pelts.   no help came from the crown, and perier, in desperation, gave a monopoly of the indian trade in the district to d'artaguette. d'artaguette went vigorously to work, and gave credit to many hunters. but they brought back few pelts to pay their debts, and soon french trade in the region was at an end. perier finally, in one last bid in 1730, cut the price of goods to an advance of 40 per cent above the cost in france. the indians were not impressed and held to the carolina traders, who swarmed over the country, almost to the mississippi.   with the loss of the mobile trade, which ended all profits from louisiana, the natchez indians revolted. they destroyed a trading house and pillaged the goods, and harassed french shipping on the mississippi. the war to subdue them taxed the resources of the colony and piled up enormous debts. in january, 1731, the company asked the crown to relieve it of the government of the colony. it stated that it had lost 20,000,000 livres in its operations, and apparently blamed its poor success largely on the indian trade. it offered to surrender its right to exclusive trade, but asked an indemnity. the king accepted the surrender and fixed the compensation of the company at 1,450,000 livres. thenceforth, the commerce of louisiana was free to all frenchmen.   company rule in louisiana left the colony without fortifications, arms, munitions, or supplies. the difficulties of trade had ruined many <voyageurs>, and numbers of them had gone to live with the natives and rear half-blood families. others left the country, and there was no one familiar with the indian trade. if this trade should be resumed, the <habitants> who had come to be farmers or artisans, and soldiers discharged from the army, must be hardened to the severe life of <coureurs de bois>. this was a slow and difficult course, and french trade suffered from the many mistakes of the new group of traders. these men were without capital or experience.   perier and salmon, the intendant, wished either to entrust the trade to an association of merchants or to have the crown furnish goods on credit to individuals who would repay their debts with pelts. bienville, who returned to succeed perier in 1732, objected that the merchants would not accept the responsibility of managing a trade in which they could see no hope of profits. he reported, too, that among the <habitants> there were none of probity and ability sufficient to justify entrusting them with the king's goods. he did find some to trust, however, and he employed the king's soldiers to trade. with no company to interfere, he kept close control over all the traders.   in order to compete with english traders, bienville radically changed the price schedule. the king should expect no profit, and an advance of only 20 per cent above the cost in france, which would cover the expense of transportation and handling, was all he charged the traders. they would not be pleased to have it published back home that they planned a frolic in paris or hong kong at the treasury's expense. they would be particularly displeased with the state department if it were the source of such reports. few things are more perilous for the state department than a displeased congressman.   the reason for this bears explaining for those who may wonder why state spends so much of its diplomatic energy on congress when the russians are so available. first, the state department is unique among government agencies for its lack of public supporters. the farmers may be aroused if congress cuts into the agriculture department's budget. businessmen will rise if congress attacks the commerce department. labor restrains undue brutality toward the labor department; the chamber of commerce, assaults upon the treasury. a kaleidoscope of pressure groups make it unpleasant for the congressman who becomes ugly toward the department of health, education, and welfare. the congressman's patriotism is always involved when he turns upon the defense department. tampering with the post office may infuriate every voter who can write.   with all these agencies, the congressman must constantly check the political wind and trim his sails accordingly. no such political restraint subdues his blood when he gazes upon the state department in anger.   in many sections he may even reap applause from press and public for giving it a good lesson. after all, the money dispensed by state goes not to the farmer, the laborer, or the businessman, but to <foreigners>. not only do these foreigners not vote for american congressmen; they are also probably ungrateful for uncle's sam's bounty. and are not the state department men who dispense this largesse merely crackpots and do-gooders who have never met a payroll? will not the righteous congressman be cheered at the polls if he reminds them to get right with america and if he saves the taxpayer some money by spoiling a few of their schemes? the chances are excellent that he will.   the result is that the state department's perpetual position before congress is the resigned pose of the whipping boy who expects to be kicked whenever the master has had a dyspeptic outing with his wife. people in this position do not offend the master by relating his peccadilloes to the newspapers. state keeps the junketeering list a secret.   the department expects and receives no thanks from congress for its discretion. congress is a harsh master. state is expected to arrange the touring cicero's foreign itinerary; its embassies are expected to supply him with reams of local money to pay his way; embassy workers are expected to entertain him according to his whim, frequently with their savings for the children's college tuition.   but come the next session of congress, state can expect only that its summer guest will bite its hand when it goes to the capitol asking money for diplomatic entertaining expenses abroad or for living expenses for its diplomats. the congressman who, in paris, may have stuffed his wallet with enough franc notes to paper the roof of notre-dame will systematically scream that a $200 increase in entertainment allowance for a second secretary is tantamount to debauchery of the treasury.in the matter of money state's most unrelenting watchdog during the eisenhower years was representative john j& rooney, of brooklyn, who controlled the purse for diplomatic administrative expenses. diplomats stayed up nights thinking of ways to attain peaceful coexistence, not with nikita khrushchev, but with john rooney. nothing worked. in the most confidential whispers ambassadors told of techniques they had tried to bring rooney around- friendly persuasion, groveling abasement, pressure subtly exerted through other powerful congressmen, tales of heartbreak and penury among a threadbare diplomatic corps. rooney remained untouched.   "the trouble" explained loy henderson, then deputy undersecretary for administration, "is that when we get into an argument with him about this thing, it always turns out that rooney knows more about our budget than we do".   one year the department collected a file of case histories to document its argument that men in the field were paying the government's entertainment bills out of personal income. news of the project reached the press. next day, reports went through the department that rooney had been outraged by what he considered a patent attempt to put public pressure on him for increased entertainment allowances and had sworn an oath that, that year, expense allowances would not rise a dollar. they didn't.   the department's constant fight with the house for money is a polite minuet compared with its periodic bloody engagements with the senate. armed with constitutional power to negate the executive's foreign policy, the senate carries a big stick and is easily provoked to use it on the state department's back, or on the head of the secretary of state.   with its power to investigate, the senate can paralyze the secretary by keeping him in a state of perpetual testimony before committees, as it did with dean acheson. john foster dulles escaped by keeping his personal show on the road and because lyndon johnson, who was then operating the senate, refused to let it become an inquisition. during dulles's first two years in office, while republicans ran the senate, the department was at the mercy of men who had thirsted for its blood since 1945.   an internal police operation managed by scott mcleod, a former f&b&i& man installed as security officer upon congressional insistence, was part of the vengeance. so was the attack upon charles e& bohlen when eisenhower appointed him ambassador to moscow. the principal mauler, however, was senator joseph mccarthy. where acheson had fought a gallant losing battle for the department, dulles fed the crocodile with his subordinates. fretting privately but eschewing public defense of his terrorized bureaucrats, dulles remained serene and detached while the hatchet men had their way.   in view of eisenhower's reluctance to concede that anything was amiss in the terror, it is doubtful that heroic intervention by dulles could have produced anything but disaster for him and the country's foreign policy. in any event, the example of acheson's trampling by the senate did not encourage dulles to provoke it. he elected to "get along".   during this dark chapter in state department history, men who had offered foreign-policy ideas later proven wrong by events filled the tumbrels sent up to capitol hill. their old errors of judgment were equated, in the curious logic of the time, with present treasonous intent. their successors, absorbing the lesson, made it a point to have few ideas.   this, in turn, brought a new fashion in senatorial criticism as the democrats took control. in the new style, the department was berated as intellectually barren and unable to produce the vital ideas needed to outwit the russians. for three or four years in the mid-1950's, this complaint was heard rumbling up from the senate floor whenever there was a dull legislative afternoon. it became smart to say that the fault was with dulles because he would not countenance thinking done by anyone but himself.   an equally tenable thesis is that the dearth of new thought was created by the senate's own penchant for crucifying anyone whose ideas seem unorthodox to the next generation. #@ getting along with foreigners#there are ninety-eight foreign embassies and legations in washington. they range from the soviet embassy on sixteenth street, a gray shuttered pile suggesting a funeral-accessories display house, to what congressman rooney has called "that monstrosity on thirty-fourth street", the modern cement-and-glass chancery of the belgians.   here is the world of the chauffeured limousine and the gossip reporter, of caviar on stale crackers and the warm martini, of the poseur, the spy, the party crasher, and the patriot, of the rented tails, the double cross, and the tired lothario.   into its chanceries each day pour reports from ministries around the earth and an endless stream of home-office instructions on how to handle uncle sam in an infinite variety of contingencies. here are hatched plans for getting a share of the american bounty, the secret of the anti-missile missile, or an invitation to dinner. out of it each week go hundreds of thousands of words purporting to inform home ministries about what is really happening inside washington. some, like the british and the french, maintain an elaborate system of personal contacts and have experts constantly studying special areas of the american scene. other embassies cable home <the new york times> without changing a comma.   each has its peculiar style. the soviet embassy is popularly regarded as russian espionage headquarters. when ambassador mikhail menshikov took it over in 1957 from georgi zaroubin, he made a determined effort to change this idea. menshikov hit washington with a ~tv announcer's grin and a hearty handclasp. to everyone's astonishment he seemed no more like the run-of-the-mine russian ambassador than george babbitt was like fyodor pavlovitch karamazov.   where his predecessors had glowered, menshikov smiled. where they had affected the bleak social style of embalmers' assistants, menshikov went abroad gorgeous in white tie and tails. overnight he became the most available man in washington. speeches by the soviet ambassador became the vogue as he obliged rural maryland rotarians and national press club alike. in senator joseph mccarthy's phrase, it was the most unheard-of thing ever heard of. a newspaperman who met him at a reception swore that he asked menshikov: "what should we call you"? and that menshikov replied: "just call me mike". "smilin' mike" was the sobriquet washington gave him. his english was usable and he used it fearlessly. toasting in champagne one night at the embassy, he hoisted his glass to a senator's wife and gaily cried: "up your bottom"! for a few giddy months that coincided with one of moscow's smiling moods, he was the sensation of washington. at the state department, hard-bitten russian experts complained that the capitol was out of its wits. newspaper punditry was inspired to remind everyone that judas, too, had been able to smile.   the menshikov interlude ended as larks with the russians usually end. finding peaceful coexistence temporarily unsuitable because of domestic politics, moscow resumed scowling and "smilin' mike" dropped quietly out of the press except for an occasional story reporting that he had been stoned somewhere in the middle west.the most inscrutable embassies are the arabs', and the most inscrutable of the arabs are the saudi arabians. when king saud visited washington, the overwhelming question consuming the press was the size of his family. rumor had it that his children numbered in the hundreds. the state department was little help on this, or on much else about saudi arabia. a reporter who consulted a middle east information officer for routine vital statistics got nowhere until the state department man produced from his bottom desk drawer a brochure published by the arabian-american oil company. "this is where i get my information from", he confided. "but bring it right back. it's the only copy i've got".   the size of saud's family was still being debated when the king appeared for his first meeting with eisenhower. when it ended, a dusky sheik in desert robes flowed into hagerty's office to report on the interview. the massed reporters brushed aside the customary bromides about saudi-american friendship to bore in on the central question. how many children did the king have?   "twenty-one", replied the sheik.and how many of these were sons?   "twenty-five", the sheik replied.   "do you mean to tell us", a reporter asked, "that the king has twenty-one children, twenty-five of whom are sons"?   the sheik smiled and murmured: "that is precisely correct".   the egyptians are noted for elusiveness of language. when dag hammarskjold was negotiating the middle east peace after israel's 1956 invasion of egypt, he soon found himself speaking the mysterious phrases of cairo, a language as anarchic as casey stengel's. the reports of president nasser's pledges which hammarskjold was relaying from cairo to washington became increasingly incomprehensible to other diplomats, including the israeli foreign minister, mrs& golda meir. finally he reported that nasser was ready to make a concrete commitment in return for israeli concessions. the deep water is used by many people, but it is always clean, for the washing is done outside. i know now why our japanese friends were surprised when they walked into our bathroom.   of course, most toilets are eastern style- at floor level- but even when they are raised to chair height, they are actually outside toilets- inside. a few newer homes have western flush toilets, but even with running water, they are usually eastern style.   the next day i visited international christian college which has developed since the war under the leadership of people who were interned and who know japan well. they are trying to demonstrate some different ways of teaching and learning. the library has open shelves even in the unbound periodical stockroom. spiritual life is cultivated, but students do not need to be christian. they have an enviable record of being able to place in employment 100% of their graduates.   in the afternoon miss hosaka and her mother invited me to go with them and young mrs& kodama to see the famous spring dances of the geisha dancers. mrs& hosaka is one of the japanese women one reads about- beautiful, artistically talented, an artful manager of her big household- (four boys and four girls), and yet looking like a pampered, gentle japanese woman. she was a real experience! the dances were as beautiful as anything i have ever seen- they rival the new york rockettes for scenery and precision as well as imagination.   because don was leaving the next day, i spent the evening with him at asia center. the following morning mr& morikawa called for me, and we went to visit schools- kindergarten, middle-school, elementary school, and high school- mr& yoshimoto's school. there is much more freedom in the schools here than i expected- some think too much.   there is a great deal of thought being given to the question of moral education in the schools. with the loss of the emperor diety in japan, the people are left in confusion with no god or moral teachings that have strength. the older parents continued to teach their children traditional principles, but the younger people, who have lost all faith and convictions, are now parents. there seems to be no purpose in life that is sure- no certain guiding principles to give stability. as a result, money is spent quickly and freely, with no thought of its value. gambling is everywhere, especially among students. parents indulge their children.   the government has recognized the dilemma and is beginning to devise some moral education for the schools- but the teachers often have no firm conviction and are confused. i was told that it is quite likely that japanese soldiers would not fight again- for why should they? it will be painful, but interesting, to see what kind of a god these people will create or what strong convictions they will develop.   in the evening the former oregon state science teachers met for dinner at the new tokyo restaurant where i had my first raw fish and found it good. they suggested several new foods, and usually i found them good, except the sweets, which i think i could learn to like. six of the science teachers were present, and we had great fun.#six#the first act of adoniram and samuel on reaching calcutta was to report at the police station, a necessity when landing in east india company territory. on the way they tried to discover all they could about burma, and they were disturbed to find that michael symes's book had not presented an altogether true picture. he had failed to realize that the burmese were not really treating him as the important visitor he considered himself. they were in fact quietly laughing at him, for their king wished to have nothing to do with the western world. when captain john gibault of salem had visited burma in 1793 his ship, the <astra>, had been promptly commandeered and taken by her captors up the irrawaddy river. although after much trouble he did manage to get it back, he discovered there was no trade to be had. all captain gibault took back to salem were a few items for the town's east india museum. a year later another salem ship returned from burma with a cargo of gum lacquer which nobody wanted to buy. after that salem ships decided to bypass unfriendly burma.   the burmese appeared to have little knowledge of british power or any idea of trade. they despised foreigners. cruel burmese governors could, on the slightest whim, take a man's life. as for missionaries, even if they succeeded in getting into the country they probably would not be allowed to preach the christian faith to the burmans. unspeakable tortures or even execution might well be their fate.   "go back to america or any other place", well-meaning friends of captain heard advised them, "but put thoughts of going to burma out of your heads".   somewhat daunted, the two american missionaries reached the police station where they were questioned by a most unfriendly clerk. when he discovered they had received from the company's court of directors no permission to live in india, coupled with the fact that they were americans who had been sent to asia to convert "the heathen", he became more belligerent than ever.   they explained that they desired only to stop in india until a ship traveling on to burma could be found. she describes, first, the imaginary reaction of a foreigner puzzled by this "unseasonable exultation"; he is answered by a confused, honest englishman. the reasons for the whig joy on this occasion are found to be their expectation of regaining control of the government, their delight at the prospect of a new war, their hopes of having the tories hanged, and so on. as for the author of the <englishman,> mrs& manley sarcastically deplores that the sole defense of the protestant cause should be left to "<ridpath, dick steele,> and their associates, with the apostles of <young man's> coffee-house".another controversy typical of the war between the <englishman> and the <examiner> centered on robert (later viscount) molesworth, a whig leader in ireland and a member of the irish privy council. on december 21, the day that the irish house of commons petitioned for removal of sir constantine phipps, their tory lord chancellor, molesworth reportedly made this remark on the defense of phipps by convocation: "they that have turned the world upside down, are come hither also". upon complaints from the lower house of convocation to the house of lords, he was removed from the privy council, his remark having been represented as a blasphemous affront to the clergy. steele, who had earlier praised molesworth in <tatler> no& 189, now defended him in <englishman> no& 46, depicting his removal as a setback to the constitution. on the other hand, molesworth was naturally assailed in the tory press. swift, in the dublin edition of <a preface to the bishop of sarum's introduction,> indicated his feelings by including molesworth, along with toland, tindal, and collins, in the group of those who, like burnet, are engaged in attacking all convocations of the clergy. in the same way he coupled molesworth and wharton in a letter to archbishop king, and he had earlier described him as "the worst of them" in some "observations" on the irish privy council submitted to oxford. a month later, in <the publick spirit of the whigs,> he used steele's defense of molesworth as evidence of his disrespect for the clergy, calling steele's position an affront to the "whole convocation of <ireland>". on this issue, then, as on so many in these months, steele and swift took rigidly opposed points of view.   in the early months of 1714, the battle between swift and steele over the issue of the succession entered its major phase. the preliminaries ended with the publication of steele's <crisis> on january 19, and from that point on the fight proceeded at a rapid pace. in answer to <the crisis,> swift produced <the publick spirit of the whigs,> his most extensive and bitter attack on his old friend. by this time, as we shall see, the tories were already planning to "punish" steele for his political writing by expelling him from the house of commons. despite his defense of himself in the final paper of the <englishman> and in his speech before the house, their efforts were successful. steele lost his seat in parliament, and his personal quarrel with swift, by now a public issue, thus reached its climax.   of all the whig tracts written in support of the succession, <the crisis> is perhaps the most significant. certainly it is the most pretentious and elaborate. hanoverian agents assisted in promoting circulation, said to have reached 40,000, and if one may judge by the reaction of swift and other government writers, the work must have had considerable impact. steele's main business here is to arouse public opinion to the immediate danger of a stuart restoration. to this end, the first and longest section of the tract cites all the laws enacted since the revolution to defend england against the "arbitrary power of a popish prince". in his comment on these laws steele sounds all the usual notes of current whig propaganda, ranging from a criticism of the tory peace to an attack on the dismissal of marlborough; but his principal theme is that the intrigues of the tories, "our popish or jacobite party", pose an immediate threat to church and state. like burnet, he deplores the indifference of the people in the face of the crisis. treasonable books striking at the hanoverian succession, he complains, are allowed to pass unnoticed. in this connection, swift, too, is drawn in for attack: "the author of the conduct of the allies has dared to drop insinuations about altering the succession". in his effort to stir the public from its lethargy, steele goes so far as to list catholic atrocities of the sort to be expected in the event of a stuart restoration, and, with rousing rhetoric, he asserts that the only preservation from these "terrours" is to be found in the laws he has so tediously cited. "it is no time", he writes, "to talk with hints and innuendos, but openly and honestly to profess our sentiments before our enemies have compleated and put their designs in execution against us".   steele apparently professed his sentiments in this book too openly and honestly for his own good, since the government was soon to use it as evidence against him in his trial before the house. in the final issues of the <englishman,> which ended just as the new session of parliament began, he provided his enemies with still more ammunition. for example, no& 56 printed the patent giving the electoral prince the title of duke of cambridge. in a few months the duke was to be the center of a controversy of some significance on the touchy question of the protestant succession. at the order of the dowager electress, the hanoverian agents, supported by the whig leaders, demanded that a writ of summons be issued which would call the duke to england to sit in parliament, thus further insuring the succession by establishing a hanoverian prince in england before the queen's death. anne was furious, and bolingbroke advised that the request be refused. oxford, realizing that the law required the issuance of the writ, took the opposite view, for which the queen never forgave him. accordingly the request was granted, but the elector himself, who had not been consulted by his mother, rejected the proposal and recalled his agent schu^tz, whose impolitic handling of the affair had caused the hanoverian interest to suffer and had made oxford's dismissal more likely than ever. steele in this paper is indicating his sympathy for such a plan. a few days after this <englishman> appeared, defoe reported to oxford that steele was expected to move in parliament that the duke be called over; defoe then commented, "if they could draw that young gentleman into their measures they would show themselves quickly, for they are not asham'd to say they want onely a head to make a beginning".   the final issue of the <englishman,> no& 57 for february 15, ran to some length and was printed as a separate pamphlet, entitled <the englishman: being the close of the paper so-called>. steele's purpose is to present a general defense of his political writing and a resume of the themes which had occupied him in the <englishman;> but there is much here also which bears directly on his personal quarrel with swift. thus he complains, with considerable justice, that the tory writers have resorted to libel instead of answering his arguments. his birth, education, and fortune, he says, have all been ridiculed simply because he has spoken with the freedom of an englishman, and he assures the reader that "whoever talks with me, is speaking to a gentleman born". as notable examples of this abuse, he quotes passages from the <examiner,> "that destroyer of all things", and <the character of richard steele,> which he here attributes to swift. though put in rather maudlin terms, steele's defense of himself has a reasonable basis. his point is simply that the tories have showered him with personal satire, despite the fact that as a private subject he has a right to speak on political matters without affronting the prerogative of the sovereign. he claims, too, that his political convictions are simply those which are called "revolution principles" and which are accepted by moderate men in both parties.   the final section of this pamphlet is of special interest in a consideration of steele's relations with swift. it purports to be a letter from steele to a friend at court, who, in miss blanchard's opinion, could only be meant as swift. steele first answers briefly the charges which his "dear old friend" has made about his pamphlet on dunkirk and his <crisis>. then he launches into an attack on the tory ministers, whom he calls the "new converts"; by this term he means to ridicule their professions of acting in the interest of the church despite their own education and manner of life- a gibe, in other words, at the "presbyterianism" in harley's family and at bolingbroke's reputed impiety. the tory leaders, he insinuates, are cynically using the church as a political "by-word" to increase party friction and keep themselves in power. this is the principal point made in this final section of <englishman> no& 57, and it caps steele's efforts in his other writing of these months to counteract the notion of the tories as a "church party" supported by the body of the clergy.   next, steele turns his attention to the "courtier" he is addressing. he explains that there are sometimes honorable courtiers, but that too often a man who succeeds at court does not hesitate to sacrifice his sovereign and nation to his own avarice and ambition. such, he implies, is the case with his friend, who is not really a new convert himself but merely a favorer of new converts. if "jack the courtier" is really to be taken as swift, the following remark is obviously steele's comment on swift's change of parties and its effect on their friendship: "i assure you, dear <jack,> when i first found out such an allay in you, as makes you of so malleable a constitution, that you may be worked into any form an artificer pleases, i foresaw i should not enjoy your favour much longer". he closes his "letter" by demanding that dunkirk be demolished, that the pretender be forced to move farther away from the coast of england, and that the queen and the house of hanover come to a better understanding. the last point was soon to be included in the "seditious" remarks used against him in parliament.the <examiner,> during steele's trial a month later, printed an answer from the "courtier" addressed to "r& s&" at button's coffee-house. he reviews steele's entrance into politics and finds that his present difficulties are due to his habit of attributing to his own abilities and talents achievements which more properly should be credited to the indulgence of his friends. once more, in other words, steele is said to be indebted to swift for his "wit"; this was the form in which their private feud most often appeared in the tory press, especially the <examiner>. in <the publick spirit of the whigs,> it may be noted, swift himself contemptuously dismissed steele's reference to his friend at court: "i suppose by the style of <old friend,> and the like, it must be some body <there> of his own level; among whom, his party have indeed more <friends> than i could wish".   on february 16, steele took his seat in parliament. by now he was undergoing a fresh torrent of abuse from tory papers and pamphlets, and action was being taken to effect his punishment by expulsion from parliament. on the very day that the parliamentary session began, another "infamous libel" appeared, entitled <a letter from the facetious dr& andrew tripe, at bath, to the venerable nestor ironside>. it is filled with the usual personal abuse of steele, especially of his physical appearance; in the opening paragraph, too, steele is accused of extreme egotism, of giving "himself the preference to all the learned, his contemporaries, from dr& sw-ft himself, even down to poet cr-spe of the customhouse". when harold arlen returned to california in the winter of 1944, it was to take up again a collaboration with johnny mercer, begun some years before. the film they did after his return was an inconsequential bit of nothing titled <out of this world,> a satire on the sinatra bobby-soxer craze. the twist lay in using bing crosby's voice on the sound track while leading man eddie bracken mouthed the words. if nothing else, at least two good songs came out of the project, "out of this world" and "june comes around every year".though they would produce some very memorable and lasting songs, arlen and mercer were not given strong material to work on. their first collaboration came close. early in 1941 they were assigned to a script titled <hot nocturne>. it purported to be a reasonably serious attempt at a treatment of jazz musicians, their aims, their problems- the tug-of-war between the "pure" and the "commercial"- and seemed a promising vehicle, for the two men shared a common interest in jazz.   johnny mercer practically grew up with the sound of jazz and the blues in his ears. he was born in savannah, georgia, in 1909. his father, george a& mercer, was descended from an honored southern family that could trace its ancestry back to one hugh mercer, who had emigrated from scotland in 1747.the lyricist's father was a lawyer who had branched out into real estate. his second wife, lillian, was the mother of john h& mercer. by the age of six young johnny indicated that he had the call. one day he followed the irish jasper greens, the town band, to a picnic and spent the entire day listening, while his family spent the day looking. the disappearance caused his family to assign a full-time maid to keeping an eye on the boy. but one afternoon mrs& mercer met her; both were obviously on the way to the mercer home. the mother inquired, "where's johnny, and why did you leave him"? "there was nothing else i could do", the maid answered, satisfied with a rather vague explanation. but mrs& mercer demanded more. the maid then told her, "because he fired me".   with her son evidencing so strong a musical bent his mother could do little else but get him started on the study of music- though she waited until he was ten- beginning with the piano and following that with the trumpet. young mercer showed a remarkable lack of aptitude for both instruments. still, he did like music making and even sang in the chapel choir of the woodberry forest school, near orange, virginia, where he sounded fine but did not matriculate too well. when he was fifteen john h& mercer turned out his first song, a jazzy little thing he called "sister susie, strut your stuff". if his scholarship and formal musicianship were not all they might have been, mercer demonstrated at an early age that he was gifted with a remarkable ear for rhythm and dialect. from his playmates in savannah, mercer had picked up, along with a soft southern dialect, traces also of the gullah dialects of africa. such speech differences made him acutely aware of the richness and expressivness of language.during the summers, while he was still in school, mercer worked for his father's firm as a messenger boy. it generally took well into the autumn for the firm to recover from the summer's help. "we'd give him things to deliver, letters, checks, deeds and things like that", remembers his half-brother walter, still in the real estate business in savannah, "and learn days later that he'd absent-mindedly stuffed them into his pocket. there they stayed". this rather detached attitude toward life's encumbrances has seemed to be the dominant trait in mercer's personality ever since. it is, however, a disarming disguise, or perhaps a shield, for not only has mercer proved himself to be one of the few great lyricists over the years, but also one who can function remarkably under pressure. he has also enjoyed a successful career as an entertainer (his records have sold in the millions) and is a sharp businessman.   he has also an extraordinary conscience. in 1927 his father's business collapsed, and, rather than go bankrupt, mercer senior turned his firm over to a bank for liquidation. he died before he could completely pay off his debts. some years later the bank handling the mercer liquidation received a check for $300,000, enough to clear up the debt. the check had been mailed from chicago, the envelope bore no return address, and the check was not signed.   "that's johnny", sighed the bank president, "the best-hearted boy in the world, but absent-minded". but mercer's explanation was simple: "i made out the check and carried it around a few days unsigned- in case i lost it". when he remembered that he might have not signed the check, mercer made out another for the same amount, instructing the bank to destroy the other- especially if he had happened to have absent-mindedly signed both of them.   when the family business failed, mercer left school and on his mother's urging- for she hoped that he would become an actor- he joined a local little theater group. when the troupe traveled to new york to participate in a one-act-play competition- and won- mercer, instead of returning with the rest of the company in triumph, remained in new york. he had talked one other member of the group to stay with him, but that friend had tired of not eating regularly and returned to savannah. but mercer hung on, living, after a fashion, in a greenwich village fourth-flight walk-up. "the place had no sink or washbasin, only a bathtub", his mother discovered when she visited him. "johnny insisted on cooking a chicken dinner in my honor- he's always been a good cook- and i'll never forget him cleaning the chicken in the tub".   a story, no doubt apocryphal, for mercer himself denies it, has him sporting a monacle in those village days. though merely clear glass, it was a distinctive trade mark for an aspiring actor who hoped to imprint himself upon the memories of producers. one day in a bar, so the legend goes, someone put a beer stein with too much force on the monacle and broke it. the innocent malfeasant, filled with that supreme sense of honor found in bars, insisted upon replacing the destroyed monacle- and did, over the protests of the former owner- with a square monacle. mercer is supposed to have refused it with, "anyone who wears a square monacle must be affected"!   everett miller, then assistant director for the <garrick gaieties>, a theatre guild production, needed a lyricist for a song he had written; he just happened not to need any actor at the moment, however. for him mercer produced the lyric to "out of breath scared to death of you", introduced in that most successful of all the <gaieties>, by sterling holloway. this 1930 edition also had songs in it by vernon duke and ira gershwin, by e& y& harburg and duke, and by harry myers. entrance into such stellar song writing company encouraged the burgeoning song writer to take a wife, elizabeth meehan, a dancer in the <gaieties>. the mercers took up residence in brooklyn, and mercer found a regular job in wall street "misplacing stocks and bonds".   when he heard that paul whiteman was looking for singers to replace the rhythm boys, mercer applied and got the job, "not for my voice, i'm sure, but because i could write songs and material generally". while with the whiteman band mercer met jerry arlen. he had yet to meet harold arlen, for although they had "collaborated" on "satan's li'l lamb", mercer and harburg had worked from a lead sheet the composer had furnished them. the lyric, mercer remembers, was tailored to fit the unusual melody.mercer's whiteman association brought him into contact with hoagy carmichael, whose "snowball" mercer relyriced as "lazybones", in which form it became a hit and marked the real beginning of mercer's song-writing career. after leaving whiteman, mercer joined the benny goodman band as a vocalist. with the help of ziggy elman, also in the band, he transformed a traditional jewish melody into a popular song, "and the angels sing". the countrywide success of "lazybones" and "and the angels sing" could only lead to hollywood, where, besides harold arlen, mercer collaborated with harry warren, jimmy van heusen, richard whiting, walter donaldson, jerome kern, and arthur schwartz. mercer has also written both music and lyrics for several songs. he may be the only song writer ever to have collaborated with a secretary of the u& s& treasury; he collaborated on a song with william hartman woodin, who was secretary of the treasury, 1932-33.   when johnny mercer and harold arlen began their collaboration in 1940, mercer, like arlen, had several substantial film songs to his credit, among them "hooray for hollywood", "ride, tenderfoot, ride", "have you got any castles, baby?", and "too marvelous for words" (all with richard whiting); with harry warren he did "the girl friend of the whirling dervish", "jeepers creepers", and "you must have been a beautiful baby". mercer's lyrics are characterized by an unerring ear for rhythmic nuances, a puckish sense of humor expressed in language with a colloquial flair. though versatile and capable of turning out a ballad lyric with the best of them, mercer's forte is a highly polished quasi-folk wit.his casual, dreamlike working methods, often as not <in absentia>, were an abrupt change from harburg's, so that arlen had to adjust again to another approach to collaboration. there were times that he worked with both lyricists simultaneously.   speaking of his work with johnny mercer, arlen says, "our working habits were strange. after we got a script and the spots for the songs were blocked out, we'd get together for an hour or so every day. while johnny made himself comfortable on the couch, i'd play the tunes for him. he has a wonderfully retentive memory. after i would finish playing the songs, he'd just go away without a comment. i wouldn't hear from him for a couple of weeks, then he'd come around with the completed lyric".   arlen is one of the few (possibly the only) composer mercer has been able to work with so closely, for they held their meetings in arlen's study. "some guys bothered me", mercer has said. "i couldn't write with them in the same room with me, but i could with harold. he is probably our most original composer; he often uses very odd rhythms, which makes it difficult, and challenging, for the lyric writer".   while arlen and mercer collaborated on <hot nocturne>, mercer worked also with arthur schwartz on another film, <navy blues>. arlen, too, worked on other projects at the same time with old friend ted koehler. besides doing a single song, "when the sun comes out", they worked on the ambitious <americanegro suite>, for voices and piano, as well as songs for films.   the <americanegro suite> is in a sense an extension of the cotton club songs in that it is a collection of negro songs, not for a night club, but for the concert stage. the work had its beginning in 1938 with an eight-bar musical strain to which koehler set the words "there'll be no more work/ there'll be no more worry", matching the spiritual feeling of the jot. this grew into the song "big time comin'". by september 1940 the suite had developed into a collection of six songs, "four spirituals, a dream, and a lullaby".   the negro composer hall johnson studied the <americanegro suite> and said of it, "of all the many songs written by white composers and employing what claims to be a negroid idiom in both words and music, these six songs by harold arlen and ted koehler easily stand far out above the rest. thoroughly modern in treatment, they are at the same time, full of simple sincerity which invariably characterizes genuine negro folk-music and are by no means to be confused with the average 'broadway spirituals' which depend for their racial flavor upon sundry allusions to the 'amen corner', 'judgement day', 'gabriel's horn', and a frustrated devil- with a few random 'hallelujahs' thrown in for good measure.i feel obliged to describe this cubbyhole. it had a single porcelain stall and but one cabinet for the chairing of the bards. it was here that the terror-stricken dennis moon played an unrehearsed role during the children's party. a much larger room, adjacent to the lavatory, served as a passageway to and from the skimpy toilet. that unused room was large enough for- well, say an elephant could get into it **h and, as a matter of fact, an elephant <did> **h   something occurred on the morning of the children's party which may illustrate the kind of trouble our restricted toilet facilities caused us. it so happened that sports writer arthur robinson got out of the hospital that morning after promising his doctor that he would be back in an hour or two to continue his convalescence. arthur robinson traveled with the baseball clubs as staff correspondent for the <american>. he was ghost writer for babe ruth, whose main talent for literary composition was the signing of his autograph. robbie was a war veteran with battle-shattered knees.   he arrived on crutches at the newspaper club with one of his great pals, oliver herford, artist, author, and foe of stupidity. mr& herford's appearance was that of a frustrated gnome. he seemed timid (<at first>), wore nose glasses from which a black ribbon dangled, and was no bigger than a jockey. robinson asked herford to escort him to the club's lavatory before they sat down for a highball and a game of cards. in the jakes, after robbie and his crutches were properly stowed, mr& herford went to the adjoining facility. he had barely assumed his stance there when a fat fellow charged through the doorway. without any regard for rest-room protocol, the hulking stranger almost knocked herford off his pins. the artist-author said nothing, but stood to one side. he waited a long time. nothing was said, nothing accomplished. the unrelieved stranger eventually turned away from the place of his- shall we dare say his waterloo?- to go to the door.   mr& herford touched the fat man's arm. "pardon me, sir. may i say that you have just demonstrated the truth of an old proverb- the younger pliny's, if memory serves me- which, translated freely from the archaic latin, says, 'the more haste, the less peed'".governor alfred e& smith was the official host at the children's party. united states senator royal s& copeland was wearing the robes of santa claus and a great white beard; the honorable robert wagner, sr&, at that time a justice of the new york supreme court, was on the reception committee. i was in charge of the arrangements- which were soon enough disarranged.   i had had difficulties from the very first day. when, in my enthusiasm, i proposed the party, my city editor (who disliked the club and many of its members) tried to block my participation in the gala event. even earlier than that he had resented the fact that i had been chosen to edit the club's <reporter>.   city editor victor watson of the new york <american> was a man of brooding suspicions and mysterious shifts of mood. mr& hearst's telegraphic code word for victor watson was "fatboy". the staff saw in him the qualities of a don cossack, hence, as mentioned before, his nickname "the hetman".the hetman's physical aspects were not those of a savage rider of the steppes. indeed, he looked more like a well-fleshed lay brother of the hospice of st& bernard. nor were his manners barbaric. he had a purring voice and poker player's immobility of features which somehow conveyed the feeling that he knew where all the bodies were buried. he was the son of a scottish father and an american jewish mother, long widowed, with whom he lived in a comfortable home in flushing. he had worked in the newspaper business since he was nineteen years old, always for the hearst service. from the very first he regarded himself as mr& hearst's disciple, defender, and afterward his prime minister, self-ordained.   it was said that the hetman plotted to take over the entire hearst newspaper empire one day by means of various coups: the destruction of editors who tried to halt his course, the unfrocking of publishers whose mistakes of judgment might be magnified in secret reports to mr& hearst. whatever the hetman's ambitions, his colleagues were kept ill at ease. among the outstanding members of the hearst cabinet whom he successfully opposed for a time were the great arthur brisbane, bradford merrill, s&s& carvalho, and colonel van hamm. he also disliked runyon, for no good reason other than the fact that the demon's talent was so marked as to put him well beyond the hetman's say-so or his supervision.   runyon, for his part, had a contemptuous regard for mr& watson. "he's a wrong-o", said runyon, "and i wouldn't trust him as far as i could throw the statue of liberty".   arthur "bugs" baer wrote to me just recently, "vic wanted to die in harness, with his head towards the wagon. he supported his mother and his brother, who afterwards committed suicide. watson told me that his brother always sent roses to his mother, blossoms bought with vic's allowance to him. 'and would you believe it', vic added, 'she likes him better than she does me. why'"?   about the only time the hetman seemed excited was when one of his own pet ideas was born. then he would get to his feet, as though rising in honor of his own remarkable powers, and say almost invariably, "gentlemen, this is an amazing story! it's bigger than the armistice".   some of the hetman's "ideas" were dream-ridden, vaguely imparted, and at times preposterous. one day he assigned me to lay bare a "plot" by the duponts to supply munitions to a wholly fictitious revolution he said was about to occur in cuba. he said that his information was so secret that he would not be able to confide in me the origin of his pipeline tip.   "i can tell you this much", he said. it's bigger than the armistice".i worked for a day on this plainly ridiculous assignment and consulted several of my own well-informed sources. then i spent the next two days at the baseball park and at jack doyle's pool parlors. when i returned to make my report, the hetman did not remember having sent me on the secret mission. he was busy, he said, in having someone submit to a monkey-gland operation. and i was to go to work on that odd matter. i shall tell of it later on.   the hetman had a strong liking for a story, any story which was to be had by means of much sleuthing or by roundabout methods. most of my stories were obtained by simply seeking out the person who could give me the facts, and not as a rule by playing clever tricks.   one day i tired of following the hetman's advice of "shadowing" and of the "ring-around-the-rosie" approach to a report that enrico caruso had pinched a lady's hip while visiting the central park monkey house. i explained my state of mind to artist winsor mccay and to "bugs" baer. mr& baer obtained a supply of crepe hair and spirit-gum from an actor at the friars. we fashioned beards, put them on, and reported to the hetman at the city desk.   mr& baer had an auburn beard, like longfellow's. mr& mccay had on a sort of emperor maximilian beard and mustache. as for myself, i had on an enormous black "muff". this, together with a derby hat and horn-rim eyeglasses, gave me the appearance of a russian nihilist."we are ready for your next mysterious assignment", said mr& baer to the hetman. "where to, sir"?   mr& watson did not have much humor in his make-up, but he managed a mirthless smile. just then a reporter telephoned in from the bronx to give the rewrite desk an account of a murder. the hetman told me to take the story over the phone and to write it. while i was sitting at one of the rewrite telephones with my derby and my great beard, arthur brisbane whizzed in with some editorial copy in his hand. he paused for a moment to look at me, then went on to the city desk to deliver his "today" column.   i thought it expedient to take off my derby, my glasses, and the beard; and also to change telephones. i managed to do this by the time the great a&b& returned to the place where he last had seen the fierce nihilist. he stood there staring with disbelief at the vacant desk. then he wrinkled his huge brow and went slowly out of the room. he had a somewhat goggle-eyed expression. he had been "seeing things".   the hetman's "ideas" for news stories or editorial campaigns were by no means always fruitless or lacking in merit. he campaigned successfully for the riddance of "death avenue" and also brought about the ending of pollution of metropolitan beaches by sewage. he exposed the bucket-shop racket with the able assistance of two excellent reporters, nat ferber and carl helm. in the conduct of these and many other campaigns, the hetman proved to be a much abler journalist than his critics allowed.it seems to me now, in a long backward glance, that many of the hetman's conceits and odd actions- together with his grim posture when brandishing the hatchet in the name of mr& hearst- were keyed with the tragedy which was to close over him one day. alone, rejected on every hand, divorced, and in financial trouble, he leaped from an eleventh-floor window of the abbey hotel in 1937.   one finds it difficult to pass censure on the lonely figure who waited for days for a saving word from his zealously served idol, w&r& hearst. that word was withheld when the need of it seemed the measure of his despair. the unfinished note, written in pencil upon the back of a used envelope, and addressed to the coroner, makes one wonder about many things: "god forgive me for everything. <i cannot> **h"   much to damon runyon's amazement, as well as my own, i got along splendidly with the hetman; that is, until i became an editor, hence, in his eyes, a rival. not long after colonel van hamm had foisted me on the watson staff i received a salary raise and a contract on the hetman's recommendation. during the next years he gave me the second of the five contracts i would sign with the hearst service. it was a somewhat unusual thing for a reporter to have a contract in those days before the epidemic of syndicated columnists. i would like to believe that my ability warranted this advancement. somehow i think that watson paid more attention to me than he otherwise might have because his foe, colonel van hamm, wouldn't touch me with a ten-foot blue pencil.   i remember one day when mr& hearst (and i never knew why <he> liked me, either) sent the hetman a telegram: "please find some more reporters like that young man from denver". watson showed this wire to colonel van hamm. the colonel grunted, then made a remark which might be construed in either of two ways. "don't bother to look any further. we already <have> the only one of its kind".   the hetman did have friends, but they were mostly outside the newspaper profession. sergeant mike donaldson, congressional medal of honor soldier, was one of them. dr& menas s& gregory was another. i used to go with watson to call on the eminent neurologist at his apartment, to sit among the doctor's excellent collection of statues, paintings, and books and drink oriental coffee while watson seemed to thaw out and become almost affable.   there was one time, however, when his face clouded and he suddenly blurted, "why did my brother commit suicide"?   i cannot remember dr& gregory's reply, if, indeed, he made one. if she were not at home, mama would see to it that a fresh white rose was there. sometimes, mrs& coolidge would close herself in the green suite on the second floor, and play the piano she had brought to the white house. mama knew she was playing her son's favorite pieces and feeling close to him, and did not disturb her.   all the rest of the days in the white house would be shadowed by the tragic loss, even though the president tried harder than ever to make his little dry jokes and to tease the people around him.   a little boy came to give the president his personal condolences, and the president gave word that any little boy who wanted to see him was to be shown in. backstairs, the maids cried a little over that, and the standing invitation was not mentioned to mrs& coolidge.   the president was even more generous with the first lady than he had been before the tragedy. he would bring her boxes of candy and other presents to coax a smile to her lips.   he brought her shawls. dresses were short in the days of mrs& coolidge, and spanish shawls were thrown over them. he got her dozens of them. one shawl was so tremendous that she could not wear it, so she draped it over the banister on the second floor, and it hung over the stairway. the president used to look at it with a ghost of a smile.   mrs& coolidge spent more time in her bedroom among her doll collection. she kept the dolls on the lincoln bed. at night, when mama would turn back the covers, she would have to take all the dolls off the bed and place them elsewhere for the night. mama always felt that the collection symbolized mrs& coolidge's wish for a little girl.   among the dolls was one that meant very much to the first lady, who would pick it up and look at it often. it had a tiny envelope tied to its wrist. an accompanying sympathetic letter explained that inside the envelope was a name for mrs& coolidge's first granddaughter. mama knew this doll was meant to help mrs& coolidge overcome her grief by turning her eyes to the future. the name inside the envelope was "cynthia".the coolidges' life, after the death of their son, was quieter than ever. john was away at school most of the time. mrs& coolidge would knit, and the president would sit reading, or playing with the many pets around them.   now and then, the president would call for "little jack, master of the hounds", which was his nickname for a messenger who had worked in the white house since teddy roosevelt's administration, and discuss the welfare of some one of the animals. it was part of little jack's work to look after the dogs.   one white house dog was immortalized in a painting. that was rob roy, who posed with mrs& coolidge for the portrait by howard chandler christy. to get him to pose, mrs& coolidge would feed him candy, so he enjoyed the portrait sessions as well as she did.   i would like to straighten out a misconception about the dress mrs& coolidge is wearing in this painting. it is not the same dress as the one on her manikin in the smithsonian. people think the dress in the picture was lengthened by an artist much later on. this is not true. the dress in the painting is a bright red, with rhinestones forming a spray on the right side. there is a long train flowing from the shoulders.   mrs& coolidge gave mama this dress for me, and i wore it many times. i still have the dress, and i hope to give it to the smithsonian institution as a memento, or, as i more fondly hope, to present it to a museum containing articles showing the daily lives of the presidents- if i can get it organized.   but to get back to the coolidge household, mrs& coolidge so obviously loved dogs, that the public sent her more dogs- calamity jane, timmy, and blackberry. the last two were a red and a black chow. rob roy remained boss of all the dogs. he showed them what to do, and taught them how to keep the maids around the white house in a state of terror.   the dogs would run through the halls after him like a burst of bullets, and all the maids would run for cover. mama didn't know what to do- whether to tell on rob roy or not- since she had the ear of mrs& coolidge more than the other maids. but she was afraid the first lady would not understand, because rob roy was a perfect angel with the first family.   every day, when the president took his nap, rob roy would stretch out on the window seat near him, like a perfect gentleman, and stare thoughtfully out the window, or he would take a little nap himself. he would not make a sound until the president had wakened and left for the office; then he would bark to let everyone know the coast was clear. his signal was for the other dogs to come running, but it was also the signal for mama and the other maids to watch out.   rob roy was self-appointed to accompany the president to his office every morning. rob roy was well aware of the importance of this mission, and he would walk in front of the president, looking neither to the right nor to the left.   at dinner, lunch, or breakfast, the president would call out, "supper"!- he called all meals supper- after the butler had announced the meal. all the dogs would dash to get on the elevator with the president and go to the dining room. they would all lie around on the rug during the meal, a very pretty sight as rob roy, prudence, and calamity jane were all snow-white.   when prudence and blackberry were too young to be trusted in the dining room, they were tied to the radiator with their leashes, and they would cry. mama tried to talk to them and keep them quiet while she tidied up the sitting room before the first family returned.   finally, mama did mention to mrs& coolidge that she felt sorry for the little dogs, and then mrs& coolidge decided to leave the radio on for them while she was gone, even though her husband disapproved of the waste of electricity.   mama was now the first maid to mrs& coolidge, because catherine, the previous first maid, had become ill and died. mrs& coolidge chose mama in her place. it was a high mark for mama.   every first family seems to have one couple upon whom it relies for true friendship. for the coolidges, it was mr& and mrs& frank w& stearns of boston, massachusetts, owners of a large department store. they seemed to be at the white house half the time. the butlers were amused because when the stearns were there, the president would say grace at breakfast. if the stearns were not there, grace would be omitted.speaking of breakfast, the president inaugurated a new custom- that of conducting business at the breakfast table. the word was that this too was part of an economy move on his part. a new bill had been passed under harding that designated the government, rather than the president, as the tab-lifter for official meals. so the president would make a hearty breakfast official by inviting government officials to attend.   he caused a lot of talk when he also chose the breakfast hour to have the barber come in and trim his hair while he ate. mama said that if presidents were supposed to be colorful, mr& coolidge certainly made a good president. he knew exactly how to be colorful!   the favorite guest of the house, as far as the staff was concerned, was mr& wrigley, the chewing gum king. the white house had chewing gum until it could chew no more, and every christmas, mr& wrigley sent the president a check for $100, to be divided among all the help. you can imagine that he got pretty good service.   another good friend of the coolidges' was george b& harvey, who was the ambassador to great britain from 1921 to 1923. he had been a friend of the hardings, and continued to be invited by the coolidges.   the first royalty whom mama ever waited on in the white house was queen marie of rumania, who came to a state dinner given in her honor on october 21, 1926. she was not an overnight guest in the white house, but mr& ike hoover, the chief usher, had mama check her fur coat when she came in, and take care of her needs. mama said she was one of the prettiest ladies she had ever seen.   mama was very patriotic, and one of the duties she was proudest of was repairing the edges of the flag that flew above the white house. actually, two flags were used at the mansion- a small one on rainy days, and a big one on bright days. the wool would become frazzled around the edges from blowing in the wind, and mama would mend it. she would often go up on the roof to see the attendant take down the flag in the evening. she used to tell me, "when i stand there and look at the flag blowing this way and that way, i have the wonderful, safe feeling that americans are protected no matter which way the wind blows".   even when mrs& coolidge was in mourning for her son, she reached out to help other people in trouble. one person she helped was my brother. mama had told her how emmett's lungs had been affected when he was gassed in the war. he was in and out of mount alto hospital for veterans any number of times.   taking a personal interest, she had the doctor assigned to the white house, dr& james coupal, look emmett over. as a result, he was sent to a hospital in arizona until his health improved enough for him to come back to washington to work in the government service. but again, there was danger that his lungs would suffer in the muggy washington weather, and he had to return to the dry climate of the west to live and work.   when mrs& coolidge was in mourning, she did not wear black. she wore grey every day, and white every evening. mama knew that she was out of mourning when she finally wore bright colors. the president helped her a lot by selecting some lovely colored dresses to get her started. she opened the boxes with a tear in her eye and a sad smile on her face.   on the social side, the chore mama had at the formal receptions at the white house thrilled her the most. it was her job to stand at the foot of the stairs, and, just as the first lady stepped off the last tread, mama would straighten out her long train before she marched to the blue room to greet her guests with the president. mama would enjoy the sight of the famous guests as much as anyone, and would note a gown here and there to tell me about that night.   one night, mama came home practically in a state of shock. she had stood at the bottom of the stairs, as usual, when mrs& coolidge came down, in the same dress that is now in the smithsonian, to greet her guests. mama stooped down to fix the train, but there was no train there! she reached and reached around the dress, but there was nothing there. she looked up and saw that, without knowing it, mrs& coolidge was holding it aloft. mrs& coolidge looked down, saw mama's horrified expression and quickly let the whole thing fall to the floor. mama swirled the train in place, and not a step was lost.   the coolidges did not always live at the white house during the presidency.impressive as this enumeration is, it barely hints at the diverse perceptions of jews, collectively or individually, that have been attested by their gentile environment. it is reasonable to affirm two propositions: <jews have been perceived by non-jews as all things to all men; some jews have in fact been all things to all men>. in the arena of power jews have at one time or another been somebody's ally; they have observed correct neutrality; they have been someone's enemy. in the market place jews have in fact under various circumstances been valued customers and suppliers, or clannish monopolists and cutthroat competitors. and so on through the roles referred to in the previous paragraph. diversity of perception, yes; diversity of fact, yes.   but the two do not invariably or even typically coincide. the "conventional" image of a particular time and place is not necessarily congruent with the image of the facts as established over the years by scholarly and scientific research. conventional images of jews have this in common with all perceptions of a configuration in which one feature is held constant: images can be both true and false.   the genuinely interesting question, then, becomes: what factors determine the degree of realism or distortion in conventional images of jews? the working test of "the facts" must always be the best available description obtainable from scholars and scientists who have applied their methods of investigation to relevant situations. granted, such "functional" images are subject to human error; they are self-correcting in the sense that they are subject to disciplined procedures that check and recheck against error.   in accounting for realism or distortion two sets of factors can be usefully distinguished: current intelligence; predispositions regarding intelligence. general grant may have been the victim of false information in the instance reported in this book; if so, he would not be the first or last commanding officer who has succumbed to bad information and dubious estimates of the future. but general grant may have been self-victimized. he may have entered the situation with predispositions that prepared him to act uncritically in the press of affairs.   predispositions, in turn, fall conveniently into two categories for purposes of analysis. to some extent predispositions are shaped by exposure to group environments. in some measure they depend upon the structure of individual personality. the anti-semitism of hitler owed something to his exposure to the ideology of lueger's politically successful christian socialist movement in vienna. but millions of human beings were exposed to lueger's propaganda and record. after allowing for group exposures, it is apparent that other factors must be considered if we are to comprehend fanaticism. these are personality factors; they include harmonies and conflicts within the whole man, and mechanisms whereby inner components are more or less smoothly met. modern psychiatric knowledge provides us with many keys to unlock the significance of behavior of the kind.the foregoing factors are pertinent to the analysis of perceptual images and the broad conditions under which they achieve realism or fall short of it. undoubtedly one merit of the vast panorama of gentile conceptions of the jew unfolded in the present anthology is that it provides a formidable body of material that invites critical examination in terms of reality. many selections are themselves convincing contributions to this appraisal.   undoubtedly, however, the significance of the volume is greater than the foregoing paragraphs suggest. speaking as a non-jew i believe that its primary contribution is in the realm of future policy. since we can neither undo nor redo the past, we are limited to the events of today and tomorrow. in this domain the simple fact of coexistence in the same local, national, and world community is enough to guarantee that we cannot refrain from having some effect, large or small, upon gentile-jewish relations. what shall these effects be?   i am deliberately raising the policy problems involved in gentile-jewish relations. comprehensive examination of any policy question calls for the performance of the intellectual tasks inseparable from any problem-solving method. the tasks are briefly indicated by these questions: what are my goals in gentile-jewish relations? what are the historical trends in this country and abroad in the extent to which these goals are effectively realized? what factors condition the degree of realization at various times and places? what is the probable course of future developments? what policies if adopted and applied in various circumstances will increase the likelihood that future events will coincide with desired events and do so at least cost in terms of all human values?it is beyond the province of this epilogue to cover policy questions of such depth and range. the discussion is therefore limited to a suggested procedure for realizing at least some of the potential importance of this volume for future policy. as a groundwork for the proposal i give some attention to the first task enumerated above, the clarification of goal.   my reply is that i associate myself with all those who affirm that gentile-jewish relations should contribute to the theory and practice of human dignity. the basic goal finds partial expression in the universal declaration of human rights, a statement initiated and endorsed by individuals and organizations of many religious and philosophical traditions.   within this frame of reference policies appropriate to claims advanced in the name of the jews depend upon which jewish identity is involved, as well as upon the nature of the claim, the characteristics of the claimant, the justifications proposed, and the predispositions of the community decision makers who are called upon to act. if jews are identified as a religious body in a controversy that comes before a national or international tribunal, it is obviously compatible with the goal of human dignity to protect freedom of worship. when decision makers act within this frame they determine whether a claim put forward in the name of religion is to be accepted by the larger community as appropriate to religion. since the recognition of israel as a nation state, claims are made in many cases which identify the claimant as a member of the new body politic. community decision makers must make up their minds whether a claim is acceptable to the larger community in terms of prevailing expectations regarding members of nation states. in free countries many controversies involve self-styled jews who use the symbol in asserting a vaguely "cultural" rather than religious or political identity. the decision maker who acts for the community as a whole must decide whether the objectives pursued and the methods used are appropriate to public policy regarding cultural groups.   we know that much is made of the multiplicity and ambiguity of the identities that cluster around the key symbol of the jew. many public and private controversies will undoubtedly continue to reflect these confusions in the mind and usage of gentile and jew. however, in the context of legal and civic policy, these controversies are less than novel. they involve similar uncertainties regarding the multiple identities of any number of non-jewish groups. so far as the existing body of formal principle and procedure is concerned, categorical novelties are not to be anticipated in jewish-gentile relationships; claims are properly disposed of according to norms common to all parties.   it is not implied that formal principles and procedures are so firmly entrenched within the public order of the world community or even of free commonwealths that they will control in all circumstances involving jews and gentiles during coming years. social process is always anchored in past predisposition; but it is perennially restructured in situations where anchors are dragged or lost. in conformance with the maximization principle we affirm that gentile-jewish relations will be harmonious or inharmonious to the degree that one relation or the other is expected by the active participants to yield the greatest net advantage, taking all value outcomes and effects into consideration. it is not difficult to anticipate circumstances in which negative tensions will cumulate; for instance, imagine the situation if israel ever joins an enemy coalition. the formal position of americans who identify themselves with one or more of the several identities of the jewish symbol is already clear; the future weight of informal factors cannot be so easily assessed.   when we consider the disorganized state of the world community, and the legacy of predispositions adversely directed against all who are identified as jews, it is obvious that the struggle for the minds and muscles of men needs to be prosecuted with increasing vigor and skill. during moments of intense crisis the responsibility of political leaders is overwhelming. but their freedom of policy is limited by the pattern of predisposition with which they and the people around them enter the crisis. at such critical moments predispositions favorable to human dignity most obviously "pay off". by the same test predispositions destructive of human personality exercise their most sinister impact, with the result that men of good will are often trapped and nullified.   among measures in anticipation of crisis are plans to inject into the turmoil as assistants of key decision makers qualified persons who are cognizant of the corrosive effect of crisis upon personal relationships and are also able to raise calm and realistic voices when overburdened leaders near the limit of self-control. we are learning how to do these things in some of the vast organized structures of modern society; the process can be accelerated.   a truism is that the time to prepare for the worst is when times are best. during intercrisis periods the educational facilities of the community have the possibility of remolding the perspectives and altering the behavior of vast numbers of human beings of every age and condition. as more men and women are made capable of living up to the challenge of decency the chances are improved that the pattern of predisposition prevailing in positions of strength in future crises can be favorably affected.   now an abiding difficulty of paragraphs like the foregoing is that they appear to preach; and in contemporary society we often complain of too much reaffirmation of the goodness of the good. in any case i do not intend to let the present occasion pass without dealing more directly with the problem of implementing good intentions. i assume that the number of readers of this anthology who regard themselves as morally perfect is small, and that most readers are willing to consider procedures by which they may gain more insight into themselves and better understanding of others. properly used, the present book is an excellent instrument of enlightenment.   let us not confuse the issue by labeling the objective or the method "psychoanalytic", for this is a well established term of art for the specific ideas and procedures initiated by sigmund freud and his followers for the study and treatment of disordered personalities. the traditional method proceeds by the technique of free association, punctuated by interpretations proposed by the psychoanalytic interviewer.   what we have in mind does have something in common with the goals of psychoanalysis and with the methods by which they are sought. for what we propose, however, a psychoanalyst is not necessary, even though one aim is to enable the reader to get beneath his own defenses- his defenses of himself to himself. for this purpose a degree of intellectual and emotional involvement is necessary; but involvement needs to be accompanied by a special frame of mind.   the relatively long and often colorful selections in this anthology enable the reader to become genuinely absorbed in what is said, whether he responds with anger or applause. but simple involvement is not enough; self-discovery calls for an open, permissive, inquiring posture of self-observation.   the symposium provides an opportunity to confront the self with specific statements which were made at particular times by identifiable communicators who were addressing definite audiences- and throughout several hundred pages everyone is talking about the same key symbol of identification.an advantage of being exposed to such specificity about an important and recurring feature of social reality is that it can be taken advantage of by the reader to examine covert as well as overt resonances within himself, resonances triggered by explicit symbols clustering around the central figure of the jew.two facets of this aspect of the literary process have special significance for our time. one, a reservation on the point i have just made, is the phenomenon of pseudo-thinking, pseudo-feeling, and pseudo-willing, which fromm discussed in <the escape from freedom>. in essence this involves grounding one's thought and emotion in the values and experience of others, rather than in one's own values and experience. there is a risk that instead of teaching a person how to be himself, reading fiction and drama may teach him how to be somebody else. clearly what the person brings to the reading is important. moreover, if the critic instructs his audience in <what> to see in a work, he is contributing to this pseudo-thinking; if he instructs them in <how> to evaluate a work, he is helping them to achieve their own identity.   the second timely part of this sketch of literature and the search for identity has to do with the difference between good and enduring literary works and the ephemeral mass culture products of today. in the range and variety of characters who, in their literary lives, get along all right with life styles one never imagined possible, there is an implicit lesson in differentiation. the reader, observing this process, might ask "why not be different"? and find in the answer a license to be a variant of the human species. the observer of television or other products for a mass audience has only a permit to be, like the models he sees, even more like everybody else. and this, i think, holds for values as well as life styles. one would need to test this proposition carefully; after all, the large (and probably unreliable) <reader's digest> literature on the "most unforgettable character i ever met" deals with village grocers, country doctors, favorite if illiterate aunts, and so forth. scientists often turn out to be idiosyncratic, too. but still, the proposition is worth examination.   it is possible that the study of literature affects the conscience, the morality, the sensitivity to some code of "right" and "wrong". i do not know that this is true; both flu^gel and ranyard west deal with the development and nature of conscience, as do such theologians as niebuhr and buber. it forms the core of many, perhaps most, problems of psychotherapy. i am not aware of great attention by any of these authors or by the psychotherapeutic profession to the role of literary study in the development of conscience- most of their attention is to a pre-literate period of life, or, for the theologians of course, to the influence of religion.   still, it would be surprising if what one reads did not contribute to one's ideas of right and wrong; certainly the awakened alarm over the comic books and the continuous concern over prurient literature indicate some peripheral aspects of this influence. probably the most important thing to focus on is not the development of conscience, which may well be almost beyond the reach of literature, but the contents of conscience, the code which is imparted to the developed or immature conscience available. this is in large part a code of behavior and a glossary of values: what is it that people do and should do and how one should regard it. in a small way this is illustrated by the nineteenth-century novelist who argued for the powerful influence of literature as a teacher of society and who illustrated this with the way a girl learned to meet her lover, how to behave, how to think about this new experience, how to exercise restraint.literature may be said to give people a sense of purpose, dedication, mission, significance. this, no doubt, is part of what gilbert seldes implies when he says of the arts, "they give form and meaning to life which might otherwise seem shapeless and without sense". men seem almost universally to want a sense of function, that is, a feeling that their existence makes a difference to someone, living or unborn, close and immediate or generalized. feeling useless seems generally to be an unpleasant sensation. a need so deeply planted, asking for direction, so to speak, is likely to be gratified by the vivid examples and heroic proportions of literature. the terms "renewal" and "refreshed", which often come up in aesthetic discussion, seem partly to derive their import from the "renewal" of purpose and a "refreshed" sense of significance a person may receive from poetry, drama, and fiction. the notion of "inspiration" is somehow cognate to this feeling. how literature does this, or for whom, is certainly not clear, but the content, form, and language of the "message", as well as the source, would all play differentiated parts in giving and molding a sense of purpose.   one of the most salient features of literary value has been deemed to be its influence upon and organization of emotion. let us differentiate a few of these ideas. the aristotelian notion of catharsis, the purging of emotion, is a persistent and viable one. the idea here is one of <discharge> but this must stand in opposition to a second view, plato's notion of the <arousal> of emotion. a third idea is that artistic literature serves to <reduce emotional conflicts,> giving a sense of serenity and calm to individuals. this is given some expression in beardsley's notion of harmony and the resolution of indecision. a fourth view is the transformation of emotion, as in housman's fine phrase on the arts: they "transform and beautify our inner nature". it is possible that the idea of <enrichment> of emotion is a fifth idea. f&s&c& northrop, in his discussion of the "functions and future of poetry", suggests this: "one of the things which makes our lives drab and empty and which leaves us, at the end of the day, fatigued and deflated spiritually is the pressure of the taxing, practical, utilitarian concern of common-sense objects. if art is to release us from these postulated things [things we must think symbolically about] and bring us back to the ineffable beauty and richness of the aesthetic component of reality in its immediacy, it must sever its connection with these common sense entities". i take the central meaning here to be the contrast between the drab empty quality of life without literature and a life enriched by it. richards' view of the aesthetic experience might constitute a sixth variety: for him it constitutes, in part, the <organization of impulses>.   a sketch of the emotional value of the study of literature would have to take account of all of these. but there is one in particular which, it seems to me, deserves special attention. in the wide range of experiences common to our earth-bound race none is more difficult to manage, more troublesome, and more enduring in its effects than the control of love and hate. the study of literature contributes to this control in a curious way. william wimsatt and cleanth brooks, it seems to me, have a penetrating insight into the way in which this control is effected: "for if we say poetry is to talk of beauty and love (and yet not aim at exciting erotic emotion or even an emotion of platonic esteem) and if it is to talk of anger and murder (and yet not aim at arousing anger and indignation)- then it may be that the poetic way of dealing with these emotions will not be any kind of intensification, compounding, or magnification, or any direct assault upon the affections at all. something indirect, mixed, reconciling, tensional might well be the strategem, the devious technique by which a poet indulged in all kinds of talk about love and anger and even in something like "expressions" of these emotions, without aiming at their incitement or even uttering anything that essentially involves their incitement". the rehearsal through literature of emotional life under controlled conditions may be a most valuable human experience. here i do not mean catharsis, the discharge of emotion. i mean something more like freud's concept of the utility of "play" to a small child: he plays "house" or "doctor" or "fireman" as a way of mastering slightly frightening experiences, reliving them imaginatively until they are under control.   there is a second feature of the influences of literature, good literature, on emotional life which may have some special value for our time. in b& m& spinley's portrayal of the underprivileged and undereducated youth of london, a salient finding was the inability to postpone gratification, a need to satisfy impulses immediately without the pleasure of anticipation or of savoring the experience. perhaps it is only an analogy, but one of the most obvious differences between cheap fiction and fiction of an enduring quality is the development of a theme or story with leisure and anticipation. anyone who has watched children develop a taste for literature will understand what i mean. it is at least possible that the capacity to postpone gratification is developed as well as expressed in a continuous and guided exposure to great literature.   in any inquiry into the way in which great literature affects the emotions, particularly with respect to the sense of harmony, or relief of tension, or sense of "a transformed inner nature" which may occur, a most careful exploration of the particular feature of the experience which produces the effect would be required. in the calm which follows the reading of a poem, for example, is the effect produced by the enforced quiet, by the musical quality of words and rhythm, by the sentiments or sense of the poem, by the associations with earlier readings, if it is familiar, by the boost to the self-esteem for the semi-literate, by the diversion of attention, by the sense of security in a legitimized withdrawal, by a kind license for some variety of fantasy life regarded as forbidden, or by half-conscious ideas about the magical power of words? these are, if the research is done with subtlety and skill, researchable topics, but the research is missing.   one of the most frequent views of the value of literature is the education of sensibility that it is thought to provide. sensibility is a vague word, covering an area of meaning rather than any precise talent, quality, or skill. among other things it means perception, discrimination, sensitivity to subtle differences. both the extent to which this is true and the limits of the field of perceptual skill involved should be acknowledged. its truth is illustrated by the skill, sensitivity, and general expertise of the english professor with whom one attends the theatre. the limits are suggested by an imaginary experiment: contrast the perceptual skill of english professors with that of their colleagues in discriminating among motor cars, political candidates, or female beauty. along these lines, the particular point that sensitivity in literature leads to sensitivity in human relations would require more proof than i have seen. in a symposium and general exploration of the field of <person perception and interpersonal behavior> the discussion does not touch upon this aspect of the subject, with one possible exception; solomon asch shows the transcultural stability of metaphors based on sensation (hot, sweet, bitter, etc&) dealing with personal qualities of human beings and events. but to go from here to the belief that those more sensitive to metaphor and language will also be more sensitive to personal differences is too great an inferential leap.   i would say, too, that the study of literature tends to give a person what i shall call <depth>. i use this term to mean three things: a search for the human significance of an event or state of affairs, a tendency to look at wholes rather than parts, and a tendency to respond to these events and wholes with feeling. it is the obverse of triviality, shallowness, emotional anaesthesia. i think these attributes cluster, but i have no evidence. in fact, i can only say this seems to me to follow from a wide, continuous, and properly guided exposure to literary art.the late r& g& collingwood, a philosopher whose work has proved helpful to many students of literature, once wrote "we are all, though many of us are snobbish enough to wish to deny it, in far closer sympathy with the art of the music-hall and picture-palace than with chaucer and cimabue, or even shakespeare and titian. by an effort of historical sympathy we can cast our minds back into the art of a remote past or an alien present, and enjoy the carvings of cavemen and japanese colour-prints; but the possibility of this effort is bound up with that development of historical thought which is the greatest achievement of our civilization in the last two centuries, and it is utterly impossible to people in whom this development has not taken place. the natural and primary aesthetic attitude is to enjoy contemporary art, to despise and dislike the art of the recent past, and wholly to ignore everything else".   one might argue that the ultimate purpose of literary scholarship is to correct this spontaneous provincialism that is likely to obscure the horizons of the general public, of the newspaper critic, and of the creative artist himself. there results a study of literature freed from the tyranny of the contemporary. such study may take many forms. the study of ideas in literature is one of these. of course, it goes without saying that no student of ideas can justifiably ignore the contemporary scene. he will frequently return to it. the continuities, contrasts, and similarities discernible when past and present are surveyed together are inexhaustible and the one is often understood through the other.   when we assert the value of such study, we find ourselves committed to an important assumption. most students of literature, whether they call themselves scholars or critics, are ready to argue that it is possible to understand literary works as well as to enjoy them. many will add that we may find our enjoyment heightened by our understanding. this understanding, of course, may in its turn take many forms and some of these- especially those most interesting to the student of comparative literature- are essentially historical. but the historian of literature need not confine his attention to biography or to stylistic questions of form, "texture", or technique. he may also consider ideas. it is true that this distinction between style and idea often approaches the arbitrary since in the end we must admit that style and content frequently influence or interpenetrate one another and sometimes appear as expressions of the same insight. but, in general, we may argue that the student can direct the primary emphasis of his attention toward one or the other.   at this point a working definition of <idea> is in order, although our first definition will have to be qualified somewhat as we proceed. the term <idea> refers to our more reflective or thoughtful consciousness as opposed to the immediacies of sensuous or emotional experience. it is through such reflection that literature approaches philosophy. an idea, let us say, may be roughtly defined as a theme or topic with which our reflection may be concerned. in this essay, we are, along with most historians, interested in the more general or more inclusive ideas, that are so to speak "writ large" in history of literature where they recur continually. outstanding among these is the idea of human nature itself, including the many definitions that have been advanced over the centuries; also secondary notions such as the perfectibility of man, the depravity of man, and the dignity of man. one might, indeed, argue that the history of ideas, in so far as it includes the literatures, must center on characterizations of human nature and that the great periods of literary achievement may be distinguished from one another by reference to the images of human nature that they succeed in fashioning.we need not, to be sure, expect to find such ideas in every piece of literature. an idea, of the sort that we have in mind, although of necessity readily available to imagination, is more general in connotation than most poetic or literary images, especially those appearing in lyric poems that seek to capture a moment of personal experience. thus burns's "<my love is like a red, red rose>" and hopkins' "<the thunder-purple sea-beach, plumed purple of thunder>" although clearly intelligible in content, hardly present ideas of the sort with which we are here concerned. on the other hand, arnold's "<the unplumbed, salt, estranging sea>", taken in its context, certainly does so.   understanding a work of art involves recognition of the ideas that it reflects or embodies. thus the student of literature may sometimes find it helpful to classify a poem or an essay as being in idea or in ideal content or subject matter typical or atypical of its period. again, he may discover embodied within its texture a theme or idea that has been presented elsewhere and at other times in various ways. our understanding will very probably require both these commentaries. very likely it will also include a recognition that the work we are reading reflects or "belongs to" some way of thought labelled as a "school" or an "-~ism", i&e& a complex or "syndrome" of ideas occurring together with sufficient prominence to warrant identification. thus ideas like "grace", "salvation", and "providence" cluster together in traditional christianity. usually the work studied offers us a special or even an individualized rendering or treatment of the ideas in question, so that the student finds it necessary to distinguish carefully between the several expressions of an "-~ism" or mode of thought. accordingly we may speak of the platonism peculiar to shelley's poems or the type of stoicism present in henley's "invictus", and we may find that describing such platonism or such stoicism and contrasting each with other expressions of the same attitude or mode of thought is a difficult and challenging enterprise. after all, shelley is no "orthodox" or hellenic platonist, and even his "romantic" platonism can be distinguished from that of his contemporaries. again, henley's attitude of defiance which colors his ideal of self-mastery is far from characteristic of a stoic thinker like marcus aurelius, whose gentle acquiescence is almost christian, comparable to the patience expressed in milton's sonnet on his own blindness.   in recent years, we have come increasingly to recognize that ideas have a history and that not the least important chapters of this history have to do with thematic or conceptual aspects of literature and the arts, although these aspects should be studied in conjunction with the history of philosophy, of religion, and of the sciences. when these fields are surveyed together, important patterns of relationship emerge indicating a vast community of reciprocal influence, a continuity of thought and expression including many traditions, primarily literary, religious, and philosophical, but frequently including contact with the fine arts and even, to some extent, with science.here we may observe that at least one modern philosophy of history is built on the assumption that ideas are the primary objectives of the historian's research. let us quote once more from r& g& collingwood: "history is properly concerned with the actions of human beings **h regarded from the outside, an action is an event or series of events occurring in the physical world; regarded from the inside, it is the carrying into action of a certain thought **h the historian's business is to penetrate to the inside of the actions with which he is dealing and reconstruct or rather rethink the thoughts which constituted them. it is a characteristic of thoughts that **h in re-thinking them we come, <ipso facto>, to understand why they were thought". such an understanding, although it must seek to be sympathetic, is not a matter of intuition. "history has this in common with every other science: that the historian is not allowed to claim any single piece of knowledge, except where he can justify his claim by exhibiting to himself in the first place, and secondly to any one else who is both able and willing to follow his demonstration, the grounds upon which it is based. this is what was meant, above, by describing history as inferential. the knowledge in virtue of which a man is an historian is a knowledge of what the evidence at his disposal proves about certain events". it is obvious that the historian who seeks to recapture the ideas that have motivated human behavior throughout a given period will find the art and literature of that age one of his central and major concerns, by no means a mere supplement or adjunct of significant historical research.   the student of ideas and their place in history will always be concerned with the patterns of transition, which are at the same time patterns of transformation, whereby ideas pass from one area of activity to another. let us survey for a moment the development of modern thought- turning our attention from the reformation toward the revolutionary and romantic movements that follow and dwelling finally on more recent decades. we may thus trace the notion of individual autonomy from its manifestation in religious practice and theological reflection through practical politics and political theory into literature and the arts. finally we may note that the idea appears in educational theory where its influence is at present widespread. no one will deny that such broad developments and transitions are of great intrinsic interest and the study of ideas in literature would be woefully incomplete without frequent reference to them. still, we must remember that we cannot construct and justify generalizations of this sort unless we are ready to consider many special instances of influence moving between such areas as theology, philosophy, political thought, and literature. the actual moments of contact are vitally important. these moments are historical events in the lives of individual authors with which the student of comparative literature must be frequently concerned.   perhaps the most powerful and most frequently recurring literary influence on the western world has been that of the old and new testament. certainly one of the most important comments that can be made upon the spiritual and cultural life of any period of western civilization during the past sixteen or seventeen centuries has to do with the way in which its leaders have read and interpreted the bible. this reading and the comments that it evoked constitute the influence. a contrast of the scripture reading of, let us say, st& augustine, john bunyan, and thomas jefferson, all three of whom found in such study a real source of enlightenment, can tell us a great deal about these three men and the age that each represented and helped bring to conscious expression. in much the same way, we recognize the importance of shakespeare's familarity with plutarch and montaigne, of shelley's study of plato's dialogues, and of coleridge's enthusiastic plundering of the writings of many philosophers and theologians from plato to schelling and william godwin, through which so many abstract ideas were brought to the attention of english men of letters.   we may also recognize cases in which the poets have influenced the philosophers and even indirectly the scientists. english philosopher samuel alexander's debt to wordsworth and meredith is a recent interesting example, as also a& n& whitehead's understanding of the english romantics, chiefly shelley and wordsworth. hegel's profound admiration for the insights of the greek tragedians indicates a broad channel of classical influence upon nineteenth-century philosophy. again the student of evolutionary biology will find a fascinating, if to our minds grotesque, anticipation of the theory of chance variations and the natural elimination of the unfit in lucretius, who in turn seems to have borrowed the concept from the philosopher empedocles.   here an important caveat is in order. we must avoid the notion, suggested to some people by examples such as those just mentioned, that ideas are "units" in some way comparable to coins or counters that can be passed intact from one group of people to another or even, for that matter, from one individual to another."suppose you take mr& hearst's morning <american> at $10,000 a year", brisbane proposed. "you could come down to the office once a day, look over a few exchanges, dictate an editorial, and then have the remainder of your time for your more serious literary labors. if within one year you can make a success out of the <american>, you can practically name your own salary thereafter. of course, if you don't make the <american> a success, hearst will have no further use for you".   the blue-eyed watson decided that he would dislike living in new york, and the deal fell through. hearst's luck was even poorer when he had a chat with franklin k& lane, a prominent california journalist and reform politician, whom he asked for his support. lane was still burning because he had narrowly missed election as governor of california in 1902 and laid his defeat to the antagonism of hearst's san francisco <examiner>. hearst disclaimed blame for this, but the conversation, according to lane, ended on a tart note.   "mr& lane", hearst said, "if you ever wish anything that i can do, all you will have to do will be to send me a telegram asking, and it will be done".   "mr& hearst", lane replied as he left, "if you ever get a telegram from me asking you to do anything, you can put the telegram down as a forgery".   hearst took a brief respite to hurry home to new york to become a father. on april 10, 1904, his first child was born, a son named george after the late senator. hearst saw his wife and child, sent a joyful message to his mother in california, and soon returned to washington, where on april 22, for the first time, he opened his mouth in congress.   this was not before the house but before the judiciary committee, where he asked for action on one of his pet bills, that calling for an investigation of the coal-railroad monopoly. attorney shearn had worked on this for two years and had succeeded in getting a report supporting his stand from the united states attorney for the southern district of new york. hearst had spent more than $60,000 of his own money in the probe, but still attorney general knox was quiescent.   six of the railroads carrying coal to tidewater from the pennsylvania fields, hearst said, not only had illegal agreements with coal operators but owned outright at least eleven mines. they had watered their stock at immense profit, then had raised the price of coal fifty cents a ton, netting themselves another $20,000,000 in annual profit.   "the attorney general has been brooding over that evidence like an old hen on a doorknob for eighteen months", hearst said. "he has not acted in any way, and won't let anyone take it away from him **h what i want is to have this evidence come before congress and if the attorney general does not report it, as i am very sure he won't, as he has refused to do anything of the kind, i then wish that a committee of seven representatives be appointed with power to take the evidence **h".the congressman tried hard, but failed. this was the very sort of legislation that roosevelt himself had in mind. there can be little doubt that there was a conspiracy in washington, overt or implied, to block anything hearst wanted, even if it was something good. hatred tied his hands in congress. roosevelt and others considered him partly responsible for the murder of mckinley. they were repelled by his noisy newspapers, his personal publicity, his presumptuous campaign for the presidential nomination, and by the swelling cloud of rumor about his moral lapses. he might get votes from his constituents, but he would never get a helping hand in congress. he was the house pariah. even the regular democrats disowned him. inherently incapable of cooperating with others, he ran his own show regardless of how many party-line democratic toes he stepped on. he was a political maverick, a reformer with his own program, determined to bulldoze it through or to blazon the infamy of those who balked him. he showed little interest in measures put forward by the regular democrats. he sought to run congress as he ran his new york <american> or <journal>, a scheme veteran legislators resisted. for a freshman congressman to read political lessons to graybeard democrats was poor policy for one who needed to make friends. he soon quarreled with all the party leaders in the house, and came to be regarded with detestation by regular democrats as a professional radical leading a small pack of obedient terriers whose constant snapping was demoralizing to party discipline.   to old-line democrats, the hearst presidential boom, now in full cry, was the joke of the new century. yet no leader had come to the fore who seemed likely to give the puissant t& r& a semblance of a race. there was talk of dragging old ex-president cleveland out of retirement for another try. some preferred judge alton b& parker of new york. there was a host of dark horses. the sneers at hearst changed to concern when it was seen that he had strong support in many parts of the country. platoons of hearst agents were traveling from state to state in a surprisingly successful search for delegates at the coming convention, and there were charges that money was doing a large part of the persuading. just when it was needed for the campaign, hearst paper no& 8, the boston <american>, began publicat
